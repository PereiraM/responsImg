{"name":"responsImg","tagline":"Responsive and retina images with breakpoints (via jQuery)","body":"# responsImg\r\nA jQuery plugin that makes your images responsive!\r\n## Why use responsImg\r\n* Multiple image sources\r\n* Easily provide high DPI (retina) alternatives\r\n* Media queries or element queries... your call!\r\n* Allow or prevent the loading of smaller images on resize or device rotation (useful when the design requires a different image when a smaller breakpoint is reached)\r\n* Doesn't use the `<picture>` tag yet since it's still a draft: the specs may change. You won't have forward compatibility issues using responsImg\r\n## How to use responImg\r\nAll you need is one line of javascript (or coffeescript) and an `<img>` tag.\r\n\r\n1. Use a super lightweight version of your image as the default `src` of your `<img>` tag. You can even leave the src empty if you really really want to...\r\n2. Add more sources in data attributes while specifying the breakpoints for each one. If you have retina versions of these images, add a comma and the path to the high DPI version.\r\n3. Add a line of jQuery calling responsImg. You're done!\r\n\r\nHere's an example of an image with a mobile portrait retina alternative.\r\n\r\n    <script>\r\n      $('.responsive-image').responsImg();\r\n    </script>\r\n    <img src=\"default-image.png\" class=\"responsive-image\"\r\n      data-responsimg320=\"mobile-portrait.png, mobile-portrait@2x.png\"\r\n      data-responsimg480=\"mobile-landscape.png\"\r\n      data-responsimg768=\"tablet-portrait.png\"\r\n      data-responsimg960=\"full-size.png\"\r\n    />\r\n\r\n### Media query or element query?\r\n\r\nBy default, responsImg relies on the viewport's size to determine breakpoints. But if like many front-end developers you prefer the idea of element queries (breakpoints determined by the size of the element itself), you can tell responsImg with a simple attribute\r\n\r\n    $('.responsive-image').responsImg({\r\n      elementQuery: true\r\n    });\r\n\r\n## Moar!\r\n* Get more details: <https://github.com/etiennetalbot/responsImg>\r\n* Check out the creator's other plugins: @etiennetalbot","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
