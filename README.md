responsImg
==========

CoffeeScript plugin to make images load the smallest possible version of itself required for the current viewport size. See it as media queries for img tags.

Requirements
------------

This plugin requires jQuery

Information
-----------
- Different image sources are set as data attributes in the `<img>` tag itself.
- You can specify @2x image sources. If specified, they will be used if the user has a retina display. Retina sizes must have a matching non-retina size in order to work. To set a retina image, add a comma and a space after the first source in a data atribute. ("image.jpg, image@2x.jpg") 
- Breakpoints are determined by the name of the data attribute. All of them must start with `data-responsimg` followed by the pixel value of the breakpoint (ex: `data-responsimg960`)
- I recommend using the smallest size as the default image (the actual `src` attribute), or else search engines won't see your image.

Parameters
----------

### allowDownsize
*(boolean) default: false* - By default, if a bigger image is already loaded, responsImg will not try to load a smaller one. To override this behavior, set to true.

Usage
-----
### JavaScript
	$('.responsive-image').responsImg({
	  allowDownsize: true
	});

### CoffeeScript
	$('.responsive-image').responsImg
	  allowDownsize: true

### HTML
	<img src="default-image.png" class="responsive-image"
	  data-responsimg320="image-320.png, image-320@2x.png"
      data-responsimg480="image-480.png"
      data-responsimg768="blue-car.png"
    />
    
In this example, the default image is `default-image.png`. This image is always loadedâ€¦ make sure it's pretty small. You could always remove the `src` attribute completely if you really wanted to.

The image `image-320.png` is loaded and displayed if the window reaches a width of **320** pixels. If the screen used is retina, the image used will only be `image-320@2x.png`. If the window reaches **480** pixels wide, `image-480.png` will be loaded and displayed. Even if you have a retina display, this image will override the previous one. If the window reaches **768** pixels wide, `blue-car.png` will be loaded and displayed.
